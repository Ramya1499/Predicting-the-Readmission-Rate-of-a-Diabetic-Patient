# Predicting-the-Readmission-Rate-of-a-Diabetic-Patient

In this project I have tried to predict the readmission rate of an diabetic patient using R Software.

The dataset folder includes all the data files used for this project along with a document which gives a descrption of each variable and its importance.

The datasets have been obtained from the UCI Repository.

The respective R Analysis files have been uploaded as well.

Additional analysis can be done by acquiring more data to predict the target feature and also involves more data preprocessing.
